GNurse is a simple injection code written in js to retrieve username, password and domain.

It was based on several repositories in Github, but I really really want to make it simple, without any program in python or c++.

To use the injection code:
- access **chrome://settings-frame/passwords**
- press **F12** on your keyboard
- put ALL code in **nurse.js** inside console section
